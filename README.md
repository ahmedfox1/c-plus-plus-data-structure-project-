## Introduction

Provide a brief overview of the project's purpose and motivation. Explain how the visualization tool aids in understanding data structures and algorithms.

## Features

* Highlight the key features of your application, such as:
    * Interactive visualization of data structure creation, manipulation, and traversal
    * Implementation of essential algorithms (BFS, DFS, etc.) 
    * User-friendly graphical interface

## Data Structures Visualized

List the specific data structures your project supports (e.g., trees, graphs, linked lists, stacks, queues).

## Algorithms Implemented

Enumerate the algorithms you've implemented for interacting with the data structures (e.g., Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search, insertion, deletion, search).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

List any software or libraries required to run your project (e.g., a specific C++ compiler, graphics library).

### Installation

Provide step-by-step instructions on how to build and install your project. Consider including commands for compiling the code and any necessary setup steps.

### Usage

Explain how to launch and interact with the application. Provide examples of how to visualize different data structures and execute algorithms.

## Screenshots (Optional)

Include a few screenshots or GIFs showcasing the visualization tool in action.

## Contributing

Explain how others can contribute to your project. Outline guidelines for submitting bug reports, feature requests, or pull requests. 

## License

Specify the license under which your project is distributed (e.g., MIT License).

## Acknowledgments
